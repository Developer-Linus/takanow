# Motivation Story Behind Project
> While walking through the busy streets of urban Kenya, I noticed a recurring and troubling scene. In several neighborhoods, piles of uncollected waste sat in open spaces, attracting swarms of flies and filling the air with an unbearable stench. Just a short distance from these illegal dumpsites, I saw cafes and restaurants serving food to customers.

> This contrast was unsettling. The thought that flies from these dumpsites could land on food being served to the public raised serious concerns. Such contamination can easily spread disease, posing a threat to public health. In a country where the healthcare system already faces immense challenges, this is a risk we cannot afford to ignore.

> That experience stayed with me. It made me reflect on the systems we have in place to manage waste, and how critical it is to keep our living environments clean. Proper waste disposal is not just about cleanliness; it is about protecting our communities from preventable diseases and maintaining the dignity of our neighborhoods.

> This realization led to the creation of TakaNow.

> TakaNow is a digital platform designed to coordinate garbage collection among landlords, agents, and waste collectors in urban areas. Its goal is to ensure that waste is managed responsibly, transparently, and efficiently. By connecting the right people and making the process more accountable, TakaNow helps create healthier, cleaner communities for everyone. Our environment is calling on us to take better care of it. TakaNow is one way we can respondâ€”by making the right choices for our health, our neighborhoods, and our future.
